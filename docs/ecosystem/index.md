This is a project-based collection of trainings designed to familiarize developers with Leverege’s tools and approach to problem solving with code. We will cover the data life cycle from ingestion to display on a custom UI. By the end of the training you will know:

how to ingest data into the Leverege platform, 

how to create and configure a project using Imagine (the UI interface to the Leverege API), 

how to create a dynamic UI based off of the data and relationships you define using our flexible Molten toolset,

how to use Imagine to customize UIs using no-code configuration options,

how to use Molten’s framework of model/view/controller plugins to customize UIs at the code level

While we are focusing on a pre-defined project with narrow parameters, you’ll have opportunities to get more in depth at every stage, and dive into the documentation and source of many of Leverege’s core libraries. We hope that you come away knowing how to get started building something that fits your specific needs, and where to look for more information.
