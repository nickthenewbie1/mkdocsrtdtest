title: Scheduler
---

Scheduler is a service that schedules timers to perform actions at a later time or in a repeating fashion. It is important to use scheduler over built in methods like `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for efficiency. Scheduler operates by saving timers to a SQL database. This database is checked at an interval specified in the config. During this check, all the timers that have reached their expiration have their functionality executed. 

Timers can be created, deleted and modified in three ways. The first way is manually through the Leverege UI, under the timers section. The second way is to start a timer message in the Leverege Platform. There are several of these messages and they can be found in detail in the [Messages](http://docs.leverege.com/docs/messages) library. The last way to interact with Timers is through the api routes exposed by scheduler.

Timers have two main attributes, the first attribute is focused on when the timers will run. Timers can be set to occur once, at a set interval or on a cron schedule. The second attribute determines what action will be taken. Actions can be to publish a message to a topic, trigger a script or query a url.

## Configuration

All configuration options for scheduler have defaults set, but important information to set up a SQL connection is included that will almost always require reconfiguring.
