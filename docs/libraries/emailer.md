Emailer's function is to receive email requests in the form of an `EmailMsg`, queue them, and then forward them to a service that will send the email. Currently Emailer is configured to use the [MailGun api](https://www.mailgun.com/), but Emailer can be configured for other services' apis such as SendGrid.

Emailer listens to the messaging service set up with the Leverege Platform. The default message reading configuration is NSQ, and the topic that emailer listens to is `email`. The format of the message is an `EmailMsg`, which can be found in the [Messages](http://docs.leverege.com/docs/messages) library, and an example is given below.

A message starts by invoking the `route` method on an instance of a writer created by [Message Queue](http://docs.leverege.com/docs/message-queue) with the `email` topic and an instance of an `EmailMsg`. Message Queue writes the message to the Transponder service, which then routes it to this service (Emailer). Emailer does a validation check to make sure the message received is an instance of an `EmailMsg`. If there is a `templateId` provided, Emailer fetches the HTML template, and [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html) is used to insert values from the `context` into the template. The Message is then sent to [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) for the email to be sent to the client.
