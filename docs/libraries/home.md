The Leverege Platform is an integrated suite of cloud-based tools that provides a complete and easy-to-use IoT application framework for System Integrators and customers;  greatly accelerating time to market and driving down implementation costs. It employs the latest advances in predictive data analytics, machine learning, containerized software design, cloud computing, and scalable pub/sub architectures. 

## Imagine

Imagine is the component of the Leverege Platform that models and simulates data streams and communications links for rapid prototyping, continuous integration and testing, and use case refinement.

Imagine begins the process of virtualizing any IoT application by defining the data model, interactions, and establishing simulated dataflows as necessary. At a high-level, Imagine encompasses three major components: 

  * Blueprint/Data Modeling 
  * Connectivity/Network Management 
  * Simulation Engine 

The Simulation provides tremendous value in expediting the product development cycle by enabling parallel development of hardware, communications, and software. Data can be simulated upfront to stress test and deliver UI prototypes while the hardware and communication layers are finalized and certified. It is also a key element to enabling continuous development and delivery of new system features. 

## Reason

Reason ingests, provisions, stores, and analyzes data plus allows custom business logic to be written and uploaded. High velocity publish/subscribe (pub/sub) message queues quickly capture data from various sources (both simulated and real) and make that data available on a message bus to other logical components. Reason’s internal message processor then routes each message according to its type. For example, telemetry data will update the real-time database for state management and be stored in a historical, time-series database for batch and stream analytic jobs. Users can provision their own algorithms known as reasoners that contain custom logic for alerting, machine learning, or analytics applications. The serverless nature of these reasoners allows each codebase to scale with the use case. 

Reason is the big data, message processing, and data analytics “brain” of the Leverege Platform. Reason supports stream analytics, batch processing, custom business logic, file storage, and device state management. It is also responsible for device provisioning and supports integrations with other critical business systems such as CRM, retail management, and inventory systems.

Reason has been built with the following goals in mind:
  * Complete data integrity with zero data loss
  * Real-time and batch process support
  * Autoscaling based on need
  * Support for client-specific business implementations
  * Generation of data-driven insights for customers
  * Maximum data portability
  * Simple 3rd party data and tools integration



## Vision

No IoT solution is complete without a polished user interface. Vision equips users with pre-made templates, customizable UI components, and apps that can be readily tailored to each IoT solution. End users can modify an existing app, customize a template, or start from scratch by defining a theme. Vision’s built-in UI builder provides fine-grain level of customization at the UI component level to support any use case or application requirement.
