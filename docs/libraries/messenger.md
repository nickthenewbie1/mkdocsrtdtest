Messenger's function is to receive SMS requests in the form of an `SmsMsg`, queue them, and then forward them to a service that will send the SMS. Currently Messenger is configured to use the [Twilio api](https://www.twilio.com/), but Messenger can be configured for other services' apis.

Messenger listens to the messaging service set up with the Leverege Platform. The default message reading configuration is NSQ, and the topic that that Messenger listens to by default is `messenger`, but can be changed through environment configuration. The format of the message is a `SmsMsg`, which can be found in the [Messages](http://docs.leverege.com/docs/messages) library, and an example is given below.

A message starts by invoking the `route` method on an instance of a writer created by [Message Queue](http://docs.leverege.com/docs/message-queue) with the topic Messenger is listening to and an instance of a `SmsMsg`. Message Queue writes the message to the transponder service, which then routes it to this service (Messenger). Messenger does a validation check to make sure the message received is an instance of an `SmsMsg`. The message is then sent to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) for the SMS to be sent to the client.
